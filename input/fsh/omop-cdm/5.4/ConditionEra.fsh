Title: "Condition Era OMOP Table"
Description: "A Condition Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is assumed to have a given condition. Similar to Drug Eras, Condition Eras are chronological periods of Condition Occurrence. Combining individual Condition Occurrences into a single Condition Era serves two purposes:

- It allows aggregation of chronic conditions that require frequent ongoing care, instead of treating each Condition Occurrence as an independent event.
- It allows aggregation of multiple, closely timed doctor visits for the same Condition to avoid double-counting the Condition Occurrences.
For example, consider a Person who visits her Primary Care Physician (PCP) and who is referred to a specialist. At a later time, the Person visits the specialist, who confirms the PCP's original diagnosis and provides the appropriate treatment to resolve the condition. These two independent doctor visits should be aggregated into one Condition Era."
