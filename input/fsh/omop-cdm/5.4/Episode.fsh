Title: "Episode OMOP Table"
Description: "The EPISODE table aggregates lower-level clinical events (VISIT_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, DEVICE_EXPOSURE) into a higher-level abstraction representing clinically and analytically relevant disease phases,outcomes and treatments. The EPISODE_EVENT table connects qualifying clinical events (VISIT_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, DEVICE_EXPOSURE) to the appropriate EPISODE entry. For example cancers including their development over time, their treatment, and final resolution."

* episode_id 1..1 integer "Episode Identifier" ""
* person_id 1..1 Reference(OMOPPerson) "Person" "The PERSON_ID of the PERSON for whom the episode is recorded."
* episode_concept_id 1..1 Reference(OMOPConcept) "Episode" "The EPISODE_CONCEPT_ID represents the kind abstraction related to the disease phase, outcome or treatment."
